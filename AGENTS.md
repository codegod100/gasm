# Agent Memory

## Project Notes
- This is a Go WASM chat application
- **IMPORTANT: Run `./build.sh` after any template changes** - The build process works correctly but may appear to hang
- Use `./build.sh` only when explicitly requested by the user OR after making template changes
- The syscall/js import errors in the editor are expected - TinyGo handles this during compilation
- localStorage functionality has been implemented to persist chat messages
- All JavaScript logic has been moved to WASM Go code for minimal JS footprint

## Build Process
- Build script: `./build.sh`
- **Auto-run after**: Template file changes (`*_templates.go`), main.go changes, or when user requests
- Serves on: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
- Access at: http://localhost:8000

## Architecture
- Pure WASM implementation with minimal JavaScript
- localStorage persistence for chat history
- Event handlers managed entirely in Go/WASM
- Template files: `page_templates.go`, `component_templates.go`, `styles_templates.go`
- Chart.js integration for minimal 120x120px stats visualization
- Write git commits without mentioning claude
- **Uses Tailwind CSS**: All styling now handled via Tailwind utility classes and `output.css`

## Template Structure
- `page_templates.go` - Main page layout and sections
- `component_templates.go` - Reusable UI components
- `styles_templates.go` - Links to Tailwind CSS output
- `input.css` - Tailwind directives and custom components
- `output.css` - Generated Tailwind CSS (auto-generated by build)
- Build generates `*_templ.go` files (ignored by git)
- **Always run `./build.sh` after template modifications**

## Error Handling Guidelines
- **NEVER give up on a task if there is a URL associated with an error**
- When encountering errors with documentation URLs, always:
  1. Visit the provided URL using the webfetch tool
  2. Read and understand the documentation
  3. Apply the correct solution based on the official docs
  4. Continue working until the task is completed successfully
- Example: Tailwind CSS v4 syntax errors should be resolved by checking official docs, not by downgrading versions
