# TinyGo WASM Chat

A basic chat application built with TinyGo that compiles to WebAssembly.

## Prerequisites

- [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/) installed
- A web browser
- A local web server (for CORS compliance)

## Building

Run the build script:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will:
1. Compile the Go code to WebAssembly using TinyGo
2. Copy the required `wasm_exec.js` file

## Running

Since browsers enforce CORS policies, you need to serve the files over HTTP:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

## Features

- Send messages with username
- View message history with timestamps
- Clear all messages
- Responsive chat interface
- Real-time message display powered by WASM
